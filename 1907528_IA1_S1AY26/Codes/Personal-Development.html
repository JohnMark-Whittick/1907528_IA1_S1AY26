        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h3>
                <p>This chapter stood out to me because I struggle with direction and motivation. It showed me that writing goals down gives clarity and purpose, and that goals are valuable not just for what they achieve, but for who I become while working toward them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Chapter 5: Proper Use of Time</h3>
                <p>Time management is one of my biggest challenges. This chapter made me realize that being busy is not the same as being productive. To grow, I need to prioritize important long-term goals instead of constantly reacting to short-term pressures.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
                <p>As a reserved person, building connections does not come naturally to me. This chapter challenged me to be intentional about who I surround myself with and to seek relationships that encourage growth, accountability, and positive influence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
                <p>This chapter reminded me that continuous learning builds confidence and adaptability. Even when motivation is low, choosing learning over passive habits is essential for personal growth, especially in a fast-changing field like data analytics.</p>
