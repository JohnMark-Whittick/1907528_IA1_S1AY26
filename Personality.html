                <h3>Reserved</h3>
                <p> Being reserved means I often prefer independent study and deep focus. While this allows me to master complex technical concepts on my own, it sometimes makes it challenging to form long lasting connections for group projects, requiring me to put in extra effort to communicate with my peers</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card trait-card">
                <h3>Calm</h3>
                <p> My calm nature helps me during exams or when when doing assignments. Instead of becoming overwhelmed, I am able to stay level-headed and approach problems methodically and logically</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card trait-card">
                <h3>Analytical</h3>
                <p> I naturally look for patterns and logic in everything I learn. This makes subjects like Statistics and  Database Analysis highly engaging for me, as I enjoy the process of turning raw academic theory into structured, usable data.</p>

        <h2>Tribute to my Mentor: Rhenovaal Clarke</h2>
        <div class="resume-card"> <blockquote>“Preparation turns uncertainty into confidence and potential into performance.”</blockquote>
            <p><strong>Background:</strong> Head of Management Information Systems and Technical Process Departments at Jamalco Bauxite Refinery.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Mr. Clarke showed me the value of care and proper preparation when he taught me that the quality of any finish is entirely dependent on the quiet work done at the start. He modeled a level of discipline where no detail was too small to ignore, proving that a calm, prepared mind is the most powerful tool in a high-pressure environment. This lesson has become the backbone of my academic life, teaching me to respect the process as much as the result.</p>

    <h2>Report: AI Businesses of 2025</h2>
    <article class="resume-card report-box">
        <h3>Favorite Idea: AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance</h3>
        <p>This idea immediately appealed to me because of my time interning at Jamalco, where I came into frequent contact with specialized instruments and heavy industrial equipment that require frequent maintenance.
            <strong>Applying AI-driven predictive maintenance</strong> in a world like Jamalco would involve using IoT sensors to monitor machine vibrations and temperatures in real-time. Instead of waiting for a breakdown, the AI would forecast failures before they happen.
            This would be <strong>incredibly useful</strong> as it prevents the massive costs of emergency repairs and the dangerous downtime that can halt production in a refinery. However, an <strong>ethical concern</strong> arises regarding Job Displacement; as AI takes over the monitoring role, the demand for traditional manual inspection roles may decrease.
            My <strong>solution</strong> is to implement "Technician Upskilling," where the existing workforce is trained to manage and interpret the AI data rather than being replaced by it. An <strong>actual application</strong> of this technology is seen in GE Digital’s SmartSignal, which helps industrial plants predict and eliminate equipment failure.
